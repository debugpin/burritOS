# CuppaOS
A Hobby Operating System

This project is a learning exercise with the following motivations and characteristics:
	- Learn more about the ARM Cortex microprocessor architectures
	- Gain a deeper understanding of Operating System design for mobile phones
	- Write a minimal Unix-inspired operating system in C++, directed towards mobile devices using ARM chips

Considerations in the design of this Operating System:
	- Keep things simple
	- What parts of the Unix system are necessary to support a mobile device OS?
	- Lightweight. Minimise dependencies on libraries
