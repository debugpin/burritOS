# burritOS

A Hobby-based OS meant for learning about OS internals.

## Motivation

- Learn more about the ARM Cortex microprocessor architectures
- Gain a deeper understanding of Operating System design for mobile phones
- Write a minimal Unix-inspired operating system, directed towards mobile devices using ARM chips

## Design considerations

- Keep it simple stupid
- What parts of the Unix system are necessary to support an ARM-based mobile device?
- Light-weight. Minimise dependencies on libraries
